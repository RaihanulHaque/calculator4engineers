Contrarily, the multipliers of a product can be depicted as the factors of that product. But remember, a factor mustn’t be a fraction number. So, we can use only the integers as the multipliers. If the factors of a number are prime numbers, then they are called prime factors.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} --><p class = "has-text-align-center" >105 = 3 x 5 x 7</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Here, 105 is the product of multiplication of 3, 5, 7.

Because if we multiply -10 with -1, we’ll get 10. So, -10 & -1 are the factors of 10. But most of the time we use positive factors only.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --><h3>2.
