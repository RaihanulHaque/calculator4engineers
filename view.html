        <!-- /wp:table --><!-- wp:heading {"level":2} --><h2>Introduction to Prime Factors</h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Before learning the methods of calculating prime factors, we should get familiar with the term prime factors. What are prime factors? And why are they called prime factors? Prime factors are those integers which can express a given number as a form of their multiplication. In other words, if we multiply two prime numbers, we’ll get another number and those previous numbers are the prime factors of the later one. We’ll be more clear with an example :</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} --><p class = "has-text-align-center" >105 = 3 x 5 x 7</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Here, the multiplication of the prime numbers 3, 5 & 7 form 105. So, 3, 5 & 7 are the prime factors of 105. From the above example, we get to know another important thing: our given number is always evenly divisible by the prime factors. As we see, 105 is evenly divisible by 3, 5 & 7. They’re being called prime factors because they are prime numbers. If they weren't prime numbers, they would’ve been called only factors.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":2} --><h2>Definition of Factorization</h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Factorization is the process to determine all the numbers that exactly divide a given number. We can find all those numbers through different calculation methods. But remember, the given number as well as the factors must be integer numbers.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":2} --><h2>Definition of Prime Factorization</h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Prime factorization is also a kind of factorization but the only difference is the factors are prime numbers in this case.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":2} --><h2>Methods of Calculating Prime Factors of 48?</h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The process of finding prime factors of a number is called prime factorization. We can determine the prime factors of 10365 in multiple ways. But here, we’ll talk about the popular methods only.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list --><ul><li>Division Method & </li><li>Factor Tree Method.</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --><h3>Factor Tree Method</h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Factor tree method, mainly a diagram based method. The reason behind this name is because  the diagram we found in the factor tree method looks like a tree. The given number is the root and prime factors are the branches of the tree. In this method, the prime factors sit at the top of every branch.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {"id":452,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none" } --><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://calculator4engineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/treefact.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-452"/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In this case, we'll represent the supplied number as the root of a tree and its factors as their respective branches. We'll use diagonals to graphically represent the relationship between the two variables and the tree structures. We'll extract just prime factors from the tree. By breaking it down into manageable chunks, we can accomplish it.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":2} --><h2>Most Commonly Asked Questions</h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --><h3>1. Are There Negative Factors?</h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Yes. Factors can also be detrimental. They are 1, 2, 5, 10, -1, -2, -5, and -10, much like the factors of 10. Because we will have 10 if we multiply -10 by -1. The factors of 10 are therefore -10 and -1. However, we tend to primarily consider good factors.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --><h3>2.
