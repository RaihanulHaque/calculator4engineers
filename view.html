On the other hand, the factors of a product can be thought of as its multipliers or divisors. However, a factor cannot be a fraction number. So, we can only use integers as the multipliers or divisors.  The term "prime factors" refers to factors that are prime numbers.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} --><p class = "has-text-align-center" >105 = 3 x 5 x 7</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In this case, multiplying 3, 5, and 7 results in 105. The multipliers are all prime numbers. The prime factors of 105 are therefore 3, 5, and 7.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":2} --><h2>What is Factorization?</h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Finding all the integers that divide a given number perfectly is a technique known as factorization.
