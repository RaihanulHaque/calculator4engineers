Contrarily, the multipliers of a product can be depicted as the factors of that product. But remember, a factor mustn’t be a fraction number. So, we can use only the integers as the multipliers. If the factors of a number are prime numbers, then they are called prime factors.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} --><p class = "has-text-align-center" >105 = 3 x 5 x 7</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Here, 105 is the product of multiplication of 3, 5, 7.
